# Multticlass-Acute-Lymphoblastic-Lukemia-Classfication-with-Natured-Inspired-Algorithm
Breast cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, and blood malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma are just a few instances of cancer, which is a collection of cells that proliferate uncontrollably within the body. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (All) is one the significant form of malignancy. This research reflects on the embodiment of a novel method for the grouping of the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with the aid of the modern technologies like Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). The proposed research pipeline is occupied into some interconnected parts such as dataset building, feature extraction with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures from each individual images of blood cells, and classification with the conventional ML based classifiers. The dataset for this study is divided into two identical categories, Benign and Malignant, and then reshaped into four significant classes, each with three subtypes of malignant, namely, Benign, Early Pre-B, Pre-B, and Pro-B. The research first extracts the features from the individual images with CNN models and then fed the extracted features to the features selections such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and SVC Feature Selectors along with two nature inspired algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO). After that, research has applied the seven ML classifiers to accomplish the multi-class malignant classification.
